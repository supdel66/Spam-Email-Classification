# 📧 Spam Email Classifier (ML Prototype)

A simple but effective machine learning-based spam email classifier, currently implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. This is the **first stage** of development and will later evolve into a full-stack product with a frontend and backend.

---

## 📓 Current Status

✅ **Prototype Phase**: Jupyter Notebook using Python for building and evaluating a basic ML model (e.g., Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression) to classify emails as "spam" or "ham".

🔜 **Next Steps**:
- Convert model to API (Flask/FastAPI)
- Build a simple frontend UI (React/Next.js)
- Full-stack deployment
